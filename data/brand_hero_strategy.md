# Livra Strategy: The Era of AI Brand Heroes

## 1. Core Philosophy: The AI Brand Hero
**Livra** is not just a simulator for virtual people; it is a **factory for Digital Brand Heroes.**

In the modern digital economy, attention is currency, and consistency is key. A **Brand Hero** is the personification of a brand's values, style, and voice. Livra allows individuals and companies to create autonomous entities that embody their brand 24/7, without the limitations of human fatigue, scheduling, or scalability.

Every Avatar created on Livra is a Brand Hero. The difference lies only in the **Role** they play to achieve the brand's goals.
