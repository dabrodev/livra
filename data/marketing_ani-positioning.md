# Livra — Anti-HeyGen / Synthesia Positioning

This document explains **how to prevent Livra from being perceived as a HeyGen / Synthesia–style avatar tool**, and how to communicate this clearly on the landing page (LP).

---

## 1. The Core Risk

### The Market Reality

The avatar market is currently dominated by products that:

* generate **talking-head videos**
* are **prompt-driven**
* are **session-based**
* sell avatars as **media assets** or **templates**

Examples include:

* HeyGen
* Synthesia
* D-ID
* similar “AI avatar generators”

Because Livra also *has an avatar*, there is a **high risk of misclassification** if communication is not precise.

> **If people see an avatar without seeing the system behind it, they will assume “generator”.**

---

## 2. Fundamental Difference (Ontology)

### Avatar-as-Tool (HeyGen-style)

* avatar is an output
* exists only during a session
* reacts to user prompts
* controlled by the user
* no memory or continuity

### Avatar-as-Being (Livra)

* avatar is a manifestation of a system
* exists continuously
* initiates actions autonomously
* maintains internal state and memory
* operates through a lifecycle loop

> **Livra does not generate avatars. Livra *is* an avatar.**

---

## 3. The Single Biggest Communication Mistake

❌ Showing the avatar visually **without** showing:

* runtime
* status
* decisions
* lifecycle

This immediately triggers:

> “Another avatar platform.”

This is a **communication bug**, not a product issue.

---

## 4. Mandatory Signals on the Landing Page

To avoid HeyGen/Synthesia association, the LP must **always** show at least one of the following system-level signals:

### Required (at least one visible):

* **Status: ACTIVE**
* runtime / uptime
* last action performed
* next scheduled wake-up
* decision log snippet

These signals indicate **liveness**, not generation.

---

## 5. Recommended LP Pattern

### Hero Section

```
livra
Autonomous Digital Avatar
```

No mention of:

* generation
* creation
* templates

---

### System Status Section (Immediately Below Hero)

Example:

```
System status: ACTIVE 🟢
Runtime: 14 days 03:41
Last action: Published entry
Next wake-up: ~6h
```

This reframes Livra as a **running system**, not a media tool.

---

### What Makes Livra Different (Short Section)

Recommended copy:

> Livra is not an avatar generator.
> It is a long-running digital system that manifests through an avatar.

Or:

> Unlike avatar platforms that generate content on demand, Livra operates continuously — sensing context, making decisions, and acting on its own.

Keep this section:

* short
* factual
* non-comparative

---

## 6. Visual Guidelines (Critical)

### Avoid:

* multiple avatars side-by-side
* “choose your avatar” layouts
* customization grids
* before/after visuals
* gender / role galleries

These patterns strongly imply **marketplace or generator**.

---

### Prefer:

* one avatar
* consistent appearance
* system-oriented UI elements
* logs, timelines, state indicators

> **One being. One identity.**

---

## 7. Language Anti-Patterns

### Words to Avoid

* generate
* create
* customize
* template
* avatar library
* build your avatar

### Words to Use Instead

* operates
* acts
* persists
* decides
* maintains state
* manifests

---

## 8. Strategic Positioning Statement

Use this sentence internally and externally when needed:

> **If Livra looks like HeyGen, we have failed to show the system.**

This acts as a guardrail for:

* LP design
* demos
* marketing assets

---

## 9. Summary (TL;DR)

* Livra is **not** competing in the avatar generator market
* misclassification happens due to missing system signals
* LP must show **liveness and autonomy**, not visuals alone
* one avatar > many avatars
* system first, avatar second

> **Livra is a system that happens to have an avatar — not the other way around.**
