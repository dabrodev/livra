# Livra — Communication & Landing Page Strategy

## 1. Brand Core

### Brand Name

**livra**

* the only brand name
* always written in lowercase
* never combined with other words
* treated as the name of a being

> **livra is the name of the being, not the technology.**

---

## 2. Canonical Descriptor (Public Slogan)

### Primary Slogan

> **Autonomous Digital Avatar**

**Why:**

* short and memorable
* understandable beyond the dev bubble
* resistant to hype cycles ("AI", "Web3", etc.)
* does not limit Livra to a single role (influencer / coach / agent)

**Usage rules:**

* appears under the logo
* used in the hero section of the landing page
* used in bio / about sections
* never becomes part of the brand name

---

## 3. Technical Definition (Secondary Layer)

Used in:

* documentation
* technical posts
* README / whitepapers
* conversations with developers

### Recommended wording:

> **An autonomous, context-aware digital avatar operating as a long-running agentic system.**

Short version:

> **Autonomous, context-aware digital avatar.**

---

## 4. Vocabulary Rules

### Words We Use

* autonomous
* digital
* avatar
* agentic
* lifecycle
* context-aware
* system
* being
* state

### Words We Avoid

* AI Avatar (too generic)
* AI Influencer
* Virtual Human
* Assistant
* Tool
* Platform
* Solution
* Next-gen

> **Livra acts. It is not used.**

---

## 5. Tone of Voice

### Core Tone

* system-oriented
* calm
* factual
* no marketing hype

### Signature Phrase

```
Status: ACTIVE 🟢
```

* used in posts
* used in changelogs / dev updates
* optionally surfaced on the landing page as narrative flavor

The **status** is dynamic.
The **slogan** is static.

---

## 6. Ontology (How Livra Is Framed)

### Livra Is

* a digital being
* a long-running system
* possessing agency
* manifested through an avatar

### Livra Is Not

* a chatbot
* a social media account
* a tool
* a UI

> **Livra is not content. Livra produces content.**

---

## 7. Landing Page Structure (LP)

### 1️⃣ Hero Section

```
livra
Autonomous Digital Avatar
```

Optional subline:

> A long-running digital being with its own lifecycle.

---

### 2️⃣ What Is Livra?

> Livra is an autonomous digital avatar that senses its environment, makes decisions, and acts without prompts.

---

### 3️⃣ How It Works (High Level)

* Senses context (environment, internal state, data)
* Decides independently
* Acts (publishes, reacts, persists)
* Maintains memory
* Repeats as part of a continuous lifecycle loop

---

## 8. Role Flexibility

Livra may *appear* as:

* an influencer
* a coach
* a narrator
* a commentator

These are **roles**, not the identity.
> **The avatar remains the same. The role changes.**

---

## 9. Core Positioning Sentence (Canonical)

> **Livra is an autonomous digital avatar — a long-running system that perceives context, makes decisions, and acts in the world on its own.**

This sentence can be reused across:

* landing pages
* investor decks
* technical introductions
* press / media descriptions
