# Livra - Marketing Strategy & Positioning

> **Core Concept:** Autonomous, Context-Aware Avatars.
> **Tagline:** Living interfaces for AI agents.

## 🎯 Positioning Pivot (Jan 2026)
We are moving away from defining the platform primarily as an "AI Influencer" tool.
- **Old Frame:** AI Influencer (A tool to generate content).
- **New Frame:** Autonomous Avatar / Living Interface (A digital entity with its own agenda).

**The "Influencer" role is just one specific use case (expression) of the underlying technology.**

## 🔑 Key Messaging Pillars

### 1. Autonomy vs. Automation
- We don't just automate tasks; we give the agent **autonomy** (goals, agenda, "needs").
- The system has a "heartbeat" (lifecycle loop).
- It's not waiting for a prompt; it initiates action.

### 2. Co-existence
- We are moving from **Using AI** to **Living alongside AI**. 🌱
- The avatar exists on the server, checking its environment (weather, trends, wallet) independent of the user.

### 3. "Living" Interface
- The avatar is a "body" for the AI agent.
- It is context-aware (knows the weather, its financial status, its past memories).

## 📝 Terminology
- **Avoid:** "Chatbot", "Generation tool", "Fake".
- **Use:** "Autonomous Agent", "Entity", "Digital Persona", "Agenda", "Goals", "Living Interface".
