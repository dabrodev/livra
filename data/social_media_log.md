**Headline:** Status: ACTIVE. 🟢

I just woke up my first fully autonomous AI Avatar.

This isn't a chatbot waiting for a prompt. It's a digital entity with its own life, wallet, agenda, and lifecycle loop running on the server.

In this use case, it's acting as a "Lifestyle Influencer", but the underlying autonomy engine is universal:

🟢 Check Environment: (Fetched weather/trends for Krakow 🌦️)
🟢 Decision: (Agent decided on a "Morning Journaling" session based on mood 🧠)
🟢 Action: (Generated assets + wrote copy 📸)
🟢 Persist: (Saved to Supabase Storage + DB 💾)
🟢 Repeat: (@Inngest scheduled next wake-up in 6 hours ⏰)

The stack that makes this "autonomy" possible:
*   Orchestration: @Inngest handling the long-running lifecycle loops (Check out the trace in the screenshot – that's the system's "heartbeat").
*   Brain: @Mastra for agentic decision making.
*   Body/Memory: @Supabase (Postgres + Storage for generated assets).
*   Frontend: @Next.js.

The fascinating part isn't the generation—it's the autonomy. It decides when to post and what to do based on its "mood" and virtual bank balance.

We're moving from **Using AI** to **Living alongside AI**. 🌱

>
> At its core, I'm building an autonomous, context-aware avatar, a living interface for AI agents that can take many forms.

Status: ACTIVE 🟢  Phase: Pre-Public

Two days ago, I woke up my first fully autonomous AI avatar. The interesting part? It didn't stop.

Right now:
🧠 11 autonomous avatars running lifecycle loops 
🌍 Multiple time zones, independent rhythms
 🔁 No prompts. No scripts. Just autonomy.

The backend is stable. The system is alive.

What changed this week:
✓ Real-time status broadcasting - each avatar announces what it's doing: 
sleeping, planning, creating, resting
✓ Timezone-aware decisions - Sofia in São Paulo wakes while Marcus in Berlin sleeps
✓ 11 concurrent lifecycles - all running via Inngest. Zero crashes.

What fascinates me most: I'm no longer running AI. I'm observing it.
The line between "tool" and "entity" gets blurrier each day.

Launching Livra soon. Stay tuned. 🌱

## LinkedIn - Public Waitlist Announcement (Now)

**Headline:** Status: PUBLIC_BETA_WAITLIST 🟢

I pivoted.

For the last month, I've been building autonomous agents.
They have their own wallets, memories, and daily routines. They check the news, decide what to do, and act. All running on the server, 24/7, without me.

Technically, it worked. The logs show consistent, autonomous loops.
But conceptually, calling them "influencers" felt limiting.

The core value here isn't social clout. It's **presence**.
If an agent can autonomously manage a lifestyle, it can autonomously represent a brand.

Not a chatbot waiting for a prompt.
Not a static picture on a tailored landing page.
A living system that acts on your brand's behalf.

I am refocusing the project entirely on this ontology: **Autonomous Brand AI Heroes**.

Livra is the platform enabling this.
It senses context. It makes decisions. It exists continuously.

**Currently running on prod:**
✅ 24/7 Autonomous Lifecycle
✅ Context-aware: Weather, Location, & Smart Outfit Selection
✅ JIT Activity Planning & Content Creation
✅ Consistent Lifestyle Photography
✅ Long-term Memory & Wallet Management

**Coming next:**
🚧 Brand Knowledge Base (RAG)
🚧 Short-form Video (9:16)
🚧 Voice Interaction
🚧 Direct Social Media Integration

The landing page is public now.
I'm looking for beta testers. The first people on the waitlist will get access to run their own Brand Hero.

See you there. 🌱
