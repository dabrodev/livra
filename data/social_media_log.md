## LinkedIn - Launch Post (Jan 2026)

**Headline:** Status: ACTIVE. 🟢

I just woke up my first fully autonomous AI Avatar.

This isn't a chatbot waiting for a prompt. It's a digital entity with its own life, wallet, agenda, and lifecycle loop running on the server.

In this use case, it's acting as a "Lifestyle Influencer", but the underlying autonomy engine is universal:

🟢 Check Environment: (Fetched weather/trends for Krakow 🌦️)
🟢 Decision: (Agent decided on a "Morning Journaling" session based on mood 🧠)
🟢 Action: (Generated assets + wrote copy 📸)
🟢 Persist: (Saved to Supabase Storage + DB 💾)
🟢 Repeat: (@Inngest scheduled next wake-up in 6 hours ⏰)

The stack that makes this "autonomy" possible:
*   Orchestration: @Inngest handling the long-running lifecycle loops (Check out the trace in the screenshot – that's the system's "heartbeat").
*   Brain: @Mastra for agentic decision making.
*   Body/Memory: @Supabase (Postgres + Storage for generated assets).
*   Frontend: @Next.js.

The fascinating part isn't the generation—it's the autonomy. It decides when to post and what to do based on its "mood" and virtual bank balance.

We're moving from **Using AI** to **Living alongside AI**. 🌱
